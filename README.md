# MIMIC-AKI-Classifier

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project designed to classify the most severe Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) stage a patient reaches during their ICU stay, using first-day ICU patient data from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The project implements a comprehensive pipeline including data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, with a focus on ensemble methods such as XGBoost and LightGBM. After Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, XGBoost was selected as the final model, achieving a macro-average AUC-ROC of 0.7025 and a test set accuracy of 0.48. This work aims to support early AKI detection in critical care settings, contributing to improved clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

## Features
- **Dataset**: Utilizes first-day ICU data from MIMIC-IV, filtered for patients aged 18â€“89.
- **Target Variable**: Classifies AKI stages into four categories (0 = No AKI, 1 = Stage 1, 2 = Stage 2, 3 = Stage 3).
